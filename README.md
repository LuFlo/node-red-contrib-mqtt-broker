# node-red-contrib-mqtt-broker

Because this MQTT broker is implemented by Node.js, you can test MQTT-in and MQTT-out nodes without MQTT environment like Mosquitto.

## Install
Run the following npm command in your Node-RED environment.
```
npm install -g node-red-contrib-mqtt-broker
```
## Flows
Once you just put this node on Node-RED and hit deploy button, MQTT Broker will run on your Node-RED.
